**Unsupervised Learning: K-Means Clustering and PCA**

**Introduction**
This project focuses on the practical implementation of unsupervised learning methods, specifically K-Means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The primary goal is to enhance the understanding and proficiency in applying these algorithms using Python and popular libraries such as Scikit-learn and Matplotlib.

**Learning Objectives**
Load Local Files: Implement techniques for loading datasets from a local file system into Python.
Data Visualization: Use various visualization techniques to interpret and present data analysis results effectively.
K-Means Clustering with Scikit-learn: Apply the K-Means clustering algorithm using Scikit-learn.
Dimensionality Reduction with PCA: Perform PCA using Scikit-learn for dimensionality reduction.
Algorithmic Understanding: Develop an understanding of the calculations performed by these algorithms to solve real-world problems.
**Project Structure**
data/: Directory containing the dataset files used for analysis.
scripts/: Directory containing Python scripts for the implementation of K-means clustering and PCA.
visualizations/: Folder with plots generated during data visualization and analysis.
README.md: Project description, setup instructions, and usage.
**Requirements**
To run the code, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

Python 3.x
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn (optional, for advanced visualizations)

**Implementation Details**
1. Loading Local Files
The dataset is loaded from the local file system using Pandas' read_csv() method. Ensure the file paths are correctly specified in the code.

2. Data Visualization
We use libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization. Various plots are created to help understand the distribution of data before and after clustering and PCA.

3. K-Means Clustering
K-Means clustering is implemented using the Scikit-learn library. The optimal number of clusters is determined through techniques like the elbow method.

4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is applied for dimensionality reduction using Scikit-learn. The results are visualized to analyze the variance explained by the principal components.

5. Algorithmic Understanding
Throughout the implementation, calculations behind K-means and PCA, such as distance measures and eigen decomposition, are explored for deeper understanding.

**How to Use**
Clone the repository.
Place the dataset in the data/ directory.
Run the K-means clustering script

**Results**
K-means Clustering: The data is grouped into distinct clusters, and the centroids are visualized.
PCA: The dataset is reduced to principal components, with the amount of variance explained visualized.
Conclusion
This project enhances the understanding of unsupervised learning algorithms such as K-means clustering and PCA, emphasizing the importance of data visualization, algorithmic understanding, and code reusability.
